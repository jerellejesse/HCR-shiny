#### Radar Chart

<br>

* also known as a spider chart
* each point represents a different performance metric
* the center is the minimum of each metric and the outer edge is the maximum of the metric
* metrics are standardized to the maximum value for each metric and equally weighted
* each HCR is a different color shaded area
* the more space the HCR takes up on the chart means it does better at achieving those metrics
