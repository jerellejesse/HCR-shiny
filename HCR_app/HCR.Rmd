### Alternative Harvest Control Rules (HCRs)
1. **Ramp**: emulates the basic structure of the current ABC control rule and promotes rebuilding and optimal yield by decreasing F gradually with SSB if SSB iss below the overfished threshold (50% SSB<sub>MSY</sub>) <br>

2. **P***: emulates the P method, which also ramps down F as SSB decreases below the overfished threshold but avoids overfishing by accounting for uncertainty with a probabilistic approach <br>

3. **F-step**: emulates a step decrease in F from 75% F<sub>MSY</sub> to 70% F<sub>MSY</sub>  <br>

4. **Constrained ramp**: emulates a ramp HCR that includes a catch variation constraint (i.e., catch advice cannot change more than 20% from the previous yearâ€™s catch)
